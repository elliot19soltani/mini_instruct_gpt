Mini Instruct-GPT
------

Mini Instruct-GPT is a lightweight, end‑to‑end framework for training and serving small instruction‑tuned language models.
It is designed to be simple, modular, and easy to extend, so you can quickly experiment with data, architectures, and training setups without heavyweight infrastructure.
The project covers the full pipeline from data preparation and formatting, through supervised fine‑tuning, to inference and evaluation, making it a practical starting point for learning, prototyping, or building custom instruction‑following models on limited compute.
